TwitterStreamTest

# Requirements:
The Twitter streaming API (https://dev.twitter.com/docs/streaming-apis) provides an endpoint that allows you

to receive a continuous stream of tweets in json format about any given keyword.

e.g. https://stream.twitter.com/1.1/statuses/filter.json?track=banking

This is an iPhone application that allows a user to see a screen that shows the 

latest 10 tweets for the keyword ‘banking’.
